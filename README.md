# Swapple - A Mobile Trading App

This project was a great opprotunity for me to learn android app development using React-Native and Google Firebase

The app's goal is to connect users who want to trade their personal belongings with others. Think of it as Facebook Marketplace, but with a collection of items that you want to trade for something else. A user can upload their own items that they want to trade and then browse other profiles to propose trades between your items and theirs.

The app is still a work in progress but here are a few screenshots showing the camera, login and profile pages:
